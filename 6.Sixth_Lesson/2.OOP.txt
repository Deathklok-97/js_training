Object Oriented Programming

Encapsulation -> Mind your own business
    
Inheritance -> I'm kind of like my parents
    
Polymorphism -> To my mom, I'm a saint
             -> To my spouse, I'm a nuisance.
             -> To my friends, I'm the Dungeon Master

Abstraction -> Wrapping up complex actions in simple verbs. 
    Describe each thing youâ€™ve abstracted clearly, and hide the complexity.
