Functional Programming


Pure Functions => Given the same input, always returns the same output. Has no side-effects.
    Basically, any function that changes its inputs or the value of some external variable is an impure function.

No side effects => Anything which makes a system unpredictable. Logging, IO, console, Api calls.
    Aims to reduce the occurrence of such effects as much as is possible.

Immutability => The idea that once a value is declared, 
    it is unchangeable and thus makes behaviors within your program far more predictable.

Referential transparency => Fancy way of saying that if you were to replace a function call 
    with its return value, the behavior of the programme would be as predictable as before.
