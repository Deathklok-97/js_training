Blocks
    Are a Grouping of a series of statements together

    var amount = 99.99;

    // a general block
    {
        amount = amount*2;
        console.log(amount)
    }

    The above is a standalone block, it is valid but not commonly seen. 
    They are usually attached to control statements

Conditionals
    Boolean logic coalesced to control execution flow of an application
    
    var ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99; 

    var bank_balance = 302.13;
    var amount = 99.99;

    amount = amount * 2;

    //can we afford the extra purchase?
    if (amount < bank_balance) {
        console.log('I will take the accessory!');
        amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
    }
    //otherwise
    else {
        console.log("No, Thanks");
    }

    Switch can also be used. It is shorthand fro a series of if..else statements 

    switch(expression) {
      case x:
        // code block
        break;
      case y:
        // code block
        break;
      default:
        // code block
    }
