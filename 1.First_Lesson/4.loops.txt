Loops
    Repeating a set of actions until until a certain conditional fails.
    A loop is comprised a test condition as well as a block. Each time the loop block executes, that's called an iteration.

    while (numOfCustomers > 0) {
        console.log("How may I help you?")
        // help

        numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;
    }

    do {
        console.log("How may I help you?");
        // help

        numberOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;
    } while (numOfCustomer > 0);

    the only practical difference is whether the conditional is tested before the first iteration (while) or after the first iteration (do.. while).


FOR LOOP
    the for loop has three clauses: the initialization clause(1), the conditional clause to test(2), and the update clause(3).

    for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
        // code block to be executed
    }
