Statements 
A group of words, numbers or operators that perform a specific task is a statement
i.e. a = b * 2

Expressions
A statement is made up of one or more expressions. 
An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) with combined with operators.
a = b * 2 has four expressions

2 is a literal value expression
b is a variable expression, which means to retrieve its current value
b * 2 is an arithmetic expression, which means to do the multiplication.
a = b * 2 is an assignment expression, which means to assign the result of b * 2 to the variable a.

Operators
    Math
    * (multiplication)
    + (addition)
    - (subtraction)
    / (division)

Compound Assignment
    +=, -= *=, /=
    a = a + 1

Equality
    == (loose equals)
    === (strict-equals)
    != (loose not-equals)
    !=== (string not-equals)

Comparisons
    < (less than)
    > (greater than)
    <= (less than or loose equals)
    >= (greater than or loose equals)

Logical 
    && (and)
    || (or)

Types
    String
    Number
    Boolean
    Arrays
    Objects
    Functions

Converting Between Types
    var a = ""
    var b = Number(a)

    console.log(a)
    console.log(b)

    Number is explicit coercion from any other type to a type of number.
    When comparing $99.99 to "99.99" you would say they are loosely equals

Code Comments
    // This is a single-line comment
    /* This is 
        a multiline 
        comment. 
                */

Variables
    Track a value as it changes over the course of the program, like a symbolic container.
    In other languages there is static typing is when the variable has the type assigned to it. 
        Prevents unintended value conversions.
    
    var amount = 99.99

    amount = amount * 2

    console.log(amount)

    amount = "$" + String(amount)

    console.log(amount)
