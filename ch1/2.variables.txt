Variables
    Track a value as it changes over the course of the program, like a symbolic container.
    In other languages there is static typing is when the variable has the type assigned to it. 
        Prevents unintended value conversions.
    
    var amount = 99.99;

    amount = amount * 2;

    console.log(amount)

    amount = "$" + String(amount);

    console.log(amount)
