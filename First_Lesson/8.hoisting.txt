    var a = 2;

    foo();

    function foo(){
        a = 3;
        console.log(a);

        var a;
    }

    console.log(a);



V2: after intro
Consider 

a = 2;

var a;

console.log( a );

vs.

console.log( a );

var a = 2;

what is the output? It's undefined. It's the chicken-and-the-egg question.
The best way to think about things is that all declarations, 
both variables and functions, are processed first, before any part of your code is executed.
When you see var a = 2;, you probably think of that as one statement. 
But JavaScript actually thinks of it as two statements: var a; and a = 2;. 
The first statement, the declaration, is processed during the compilation phase. 
The second statement, the assignment, is left in place for the execution phase.
