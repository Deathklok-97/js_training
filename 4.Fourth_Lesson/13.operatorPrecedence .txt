Operator Precedence

    && and || are interesting in that they select and return one of their operands,
    rather than just resulting in true or false. 
    That's easy to reason about if there are only two operands and one operator.

    var a = 42;
    var b = "foo";

    a && b;	// "foo"
    a || b;	// 42
