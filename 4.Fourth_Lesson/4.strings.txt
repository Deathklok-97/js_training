Strings

    It's a very common belief that strings are essentially just arrays of characters. 
    While the implementation under the covers may or may not use arrays, 
    it's important to realize that JavaScript strings are really not the same as arrays of characters. 
    The similarity is mostly just skin-deep.


a[1] = "O";
b[1] = "O";

a; // "foo"
b; // ["f","O","o"]

A consequence of immutable strings is that none of the string methods that alter its contents can modify in-place, but rather must create and return new strings. 
By contrast, many of the methods that change array contents actually do modify in-place.
