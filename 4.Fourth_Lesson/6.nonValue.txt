Null and Undefined

    null is an empty value
    undefined is a missing value

Void 
    the void operator can be useful in a few circumstances, 
    if you need to ensure that an expression has no result value (even if it has side effects)

    var a = 42;

    console.log( void a, a ); 

Special Numbers

    var a = 2 / "foo";
    typeof a === "number";	

    NaN is the only value not equal to itself
    NaN !== NaN
    It doesn't have an Identity characteristic

Infinity 

    var a = 1 / 0;	// Infinity
    var b = -1 / 0;	// -Infinity
