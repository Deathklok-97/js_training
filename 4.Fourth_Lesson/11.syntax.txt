Syntax 
    
    The term "grammar" may be a little less familiar to readers than the term "syntax."

    A "sentence" is one complete formation of words that expresses a thought. 
    It's comprised of one or more "phrases," each of which can be connected with punctuation marks or conjunction words ("and," "or," etc). 
    A phrase can itself be made up of smaller phrases. 
    Some phrases are incomplete and don't accomplish much by themselves, 
    while other phrases can stand on their own. 
    These rules are collectively called the grammar of the English language.
