Array
 
    As compared to other type-enforced languages, 
    JavaScript arrays are just containers for any type of value, 
    from string to number to object to even another array (which is how you get multidimensional arrays).
    Can hold different types, like an improper list. 

    syntax:
        var a = [];

    var a = [ 1, "2", [3] ];

    a.length;		// 3
    a[0] === 1;		// true
    a[2][0] === 3;	// true
